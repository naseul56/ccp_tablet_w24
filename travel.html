                <p>Yellowstone National Park, established in 1872 in the U.S., is known as the world’s first national park. It's revered for its geothermal features, including over half of the world's geysers, and its diverse wildlife such as grizzly bears, wolves, and herds of bison and elk.</p>
                <p>The park's massive 2.2 million acre size includes picturesque landscapes of mountains, lakes, canyons, and rivers. Yellowstone also houses the Yellowstone Caldera, one of the earth's largest active volcanic systems, contributing to its unique geological attractions.</p>
